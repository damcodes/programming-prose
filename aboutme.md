### My story

My name is David Molina. On October 5th 2020 I embarked on a new journey--the Immersive Software Engineering program at the Flatiron School. I had heard a lot about Flatiron School through some  podcasts. The idea of becoming a software engineer without the overbearing student debt or 4+ years (maybe _more_ if you're a regular person working full-time) of post-secondary education seemed too good to be true. Still, I submitted my inquiry, and a couple months later.. Well, _here I am_. 


As you read my blog, I hope to help you, to inspire you, and to excite you about the world of programming. As I am just now embarking on this new path as well, I will never know everything. To my understanding, though, **never** knowing everything is an implicit aspect of being a programmer. I don't know about you, but that's what excites me most about this field. I'll never plateau. From this day until my last (working day), there will always be a new chapter to read. I get to exist in a constant state of learning.
