### Enter Wizard Boy

As kids, my sister and I LARPed (Live Action Role Play), as many kids did before iPads and Fortnite and smartphones. We each had our own hero alter-ego. I was Wizard Boy--I've always been obsessed with fantasy and the supernatural, but not too creative. You would think for a wand I'd have found a good twig to use, but you'd be mistaken. At the time, there was a show on Disney Channel called Kim Possible and my favorite character was Wade, a 10-year-old tech **_genius_**. In the show, he mostly existed on the PDA (look it up) he programmed for Kim, where he could be seen and heard clacking away on his keyboard, making magic happen to save the day. As cool as Kim was being a spy or whatever, I knew the real MVP was Wade, for Kim would be nothing without all the tech Wade made for her.

Anyway, my siblings and I lived with our grandparents and we didn't own a computer, but one day while exploring the wild jungle that was their garage, I found a keyboard. It was kismet. From then on, Wizard Boy was a keyboard-wielding mage, vanquishing evil from the land one keystroke at a time. Point being, from a young age, I knew software engineers were modern day, real life magic users. 

### 15 Years Later

Fast forward to today and here I am, actually learning to become the wizard young me aspired to be. It's definitely not as magical as I thought it would be, though. Or maybe, it's _too_ magical. 

In addition to being an aspiring wizard as a kid, I was also quite the stubborn smartass. A smartass with an incessant need to understand underlying meaning in everything. 

> **Adult:** "The sky is blue."
> Me: "Why?"
> **Adult:** "Because it is."
> **Me:** "Okay. But _why?_"
> **Adult:** "I'm not a scientist, I don't know."
> **Me:** "WELL WHY AREN'T YOU?"
> **Scientist:** "The sky is blue because the gases in our atmosphere scatter the light from the sun. Blue light gets scattered more than any other color because it has the shortest wavelength, thus having the highest frequeny and carrying the most energy, translating to us perceiving the sky as blue most of the time. 
> **Me:** "Awesome! But.. Why?"

As I'm progressing through each phase at Flatiron, though, these two parts of myself are beginning to conflict. At Flatiron, we are learning all the latest concepts, practices, and frameworks. All the cutting edge spells and potions. While it's awesome, and deploying a whole web app with just a few spells, a few commands in the terminal, really feels like performing magic, my more analytical self is really struggling to accept it.
