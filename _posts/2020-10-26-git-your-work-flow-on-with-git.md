Git. _Git?_ **GIT!**
What is git? Must I master it to truly call myself a competent programmer?
What's _really_ the point?

Git is a [version control system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/#:~:text=Version%20control%20systems%20are%20a,(snapshots)%20of%20the%20project.)(VSC). The point of any version control system is to offer some sort of mechanism to log checkpoints in your progress.
The mechanism provided to us by git logs checkpoints by "taking a picture", let's call it picture A, of the current state of your code, pointing to picture A as the most recent version of your code, and adding the picture to a collection of _all_ pictures taken of your code. Until you command git to take another picture, that is, you specify a more recent checkpoint in your progress, git will continue to point to picture A as the most up-to-date version of your code. 


1. git add
2. git commit
3. git push
