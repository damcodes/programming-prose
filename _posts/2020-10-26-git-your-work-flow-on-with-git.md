Git. _Git?_ **GIT!**
What is git? Must I master it to truly call myself a competent programmer?
What's _really_ the point?

In short, git is a [version control system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/#:~:text=Version%20control%20systems%20are%20a,(snapshots)%20of%20the%20project.)(VSC). Bear with me while we get a little metaphorical.

Imagine git is a modern day camera. It takes a picture of the current state of your code.
